/*
    Java Static Variable-->  When we use a static keyword with a variable, then it is known as a static variable.

    ** The static  variable will be shared among all the objects of the class.
    ** Memory is allocated to the static varible only once in the class are at the tiem of class loading.

    ** Advantage of static variable

    It makes program memory efficient
