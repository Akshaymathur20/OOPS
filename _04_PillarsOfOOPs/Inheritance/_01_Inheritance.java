/*
   Inheritacne --> The term "Inheritance" means receiving some quality or behaviour from a parent to an offsfering.
   Inheritance is a mechanism in java by which one class is allowed to inherit the feature of another class.
   Inheritance means creating new classes based on the existing ones.

   **A class that inherits from another class can reuse the methods and fields of that class. In addition, we can add new fields and methods to our current class as well.


   *****Why do we need Java Inheritance*******

   Code Resuability--> The code written in the superclass is common to all subclasses. 
   Method Overriding--> Method overriding is achievable only through inheritance .It is one of the ways by which java achieves Run Time Polymorphism.
   Abstraction---> the concept of abstract where we do not have to provide all details is achieved through inheritance. Abstraction only shows the funtionality to the user.


   **********Types of Inheritacne*********
   1)Single
   2) Multi-Level
   3)Hierarchical
   4) Multiple
   5) Hybrid

   **Mutiple Inheritance is not supported in Java***
