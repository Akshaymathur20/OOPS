/*
 * PolyMorphism--> The term polymorpism is the combination of two "poly" which means many and morphism which means "shapes".
 * 
 * Let's take an example like a man at the same time is doing differnt jobs
 * --> he is the son of his parents
 * --> he is the father of his children
 * --> he is the husband of his wife
 * --> he is the brother of his sister/brother
 * 
 * ---------In terms of OOps -------------
 * Polymorphism refers to the fact that something exist in multiple forms.
 * "It is the ability of  a message to be displayed in multiple formats."
 * 
 * 
 * Advantages of Polymorphism--------------->
 * 
1-->PolyMorphism incrase code resuability by allowing object of differnt classes to be treated as objects of a common class.

2--> PolyMorphism improves readability and maintainbility of cose by reducing the amount of code the needs to be written and maintained
3--> PolyMorphism supports dynamic binding, enabling the correct method to   be called at runtime, based on the actual class of the object
4--> PolyMorphism enables objects to be treted as a single types, making   it     easier to write generic code that can handle objects of different types.

Disadvantages of Polymorphism
Can make it more difficult to understand the behaviour of an object, especially if the code is complex
This may lead to performance issues, as polymorphic behavior may require additional computations at runtime
