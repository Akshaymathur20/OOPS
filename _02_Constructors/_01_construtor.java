/*
  Constructor -> Constructor is a special method because it does not have a return type. Constructor is used to intialise the object when an object of class is created in the program. As the name suggests. the constructor is used to construct the object of a class.

  --*--A constructor's name must be exactly the same as the name of its class.
  ---*-- The constructor is special method because it does not have a return type . We do not even need to write void as the return type.

  --*-- Every time an object is created using the new() keyword, at least one constructor is called.
